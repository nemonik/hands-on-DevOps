# Gitlab

GitLab Community Edition (CE) is an open source software development platform with built-in version control, issue tracking, code review, CICD, etc.

To spin up:

```
dcoker-compose build
docker_compose up
```

Monitor the logs via

```
docker logs -f gitlab_gitlab_1
```

Wait for the list line of log output:
